**Analysis of poly(A) tail lengths for Turtola et al.**

The code describes the analysis and visualisation of poly(A) tail lengths presented in Figures 1, S1, 2 and S2.

Source data files (pA.rds; 4tU_pA.rds; CYC1_classes.rds; CYC1_alignment files) can be accessed through:

These files contain nanopore DRS reads aligning to the yeast reference genome with poly(A) tail lengths estimated by the Nanopolish 0.13.2 polya function, with QC tag that was reported by Nanopolish as PASS.

Raw nanopore sequencing data (fast5 files) are deposited at European Nucleotide Archive.
